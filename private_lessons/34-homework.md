# Crossing Souls

Recently I've finished the game Crossing Souls.
It is a adventure videogame with pixel graphic.
It has a beat 'em up, platformer and puzzle mechanichs.
There is an interesting fact about this game - it was sponsored via Kickstarter.
And the main selling point was nostalgia for the 80's: VHS videoplayers, game consoles with cartridges, magnet cassets, action movies with brutal men.

In the game you play by a group of younglings: smart guy, black fat but strong boy, agile girl, leader of the band and his younger ghost brother.

The game gives plenty of game mechanics after the prologue but after the middle part of the game they confiscates them one by one.

Platformer parts are really bad. Downward camera angle maked it even worse. Design and color scheme of platforms are not clear enough to calculate their hight.
That desorientate a player and force him to make mistakes.

Girl is not useful. Her main ability - a long jump has used only three times in the whole game. So her only part in this game is to be a crush of the main character and to take a part in the story.

Beat 'em up part doesn't give a challenge. Different kinds of enemies have different dynamic but the same moveset.
Only bosses are not so monotonic and interesting to compete.

There are some minigames between the parts of the main gameplay: bicycle ride with a subway surf mechanic, decypher puzzle, back-to-the-future car QTE, and most hated of all - glider bullethell.
In this minigame you have to dodge a huge amount of enemy projectiles along the determined amount of time.
I had spent a lot of attempts, but I had kept failing one time after another. And every time my glider blowed up into pieces. And when I finally had avoided all of enemy missiles and projectiles and had thought that it was a victory, my glider crushed.
But this time it was directed by the scenario.
I was so angry.
More than 10 attempts, every of them ended up with the glider crush and the last crush that was counted as succesful by the game. OMG!

What is not so bad is a scenario. It is not childish and raises deep questions about the life and death, about the friendship, self-sacrifice and some more.
In the end of the game only one member of the band is alive: the girl.

Why this game was so successful?
I guess that it banged because of right setting and good marketing.
There is a lot of nostalgia for the 80's nowadays.
Even in those who have never lived when.
In a couple with a good pitching on the croud funding platform it leds to a great financial success.
