- merge of the projects
- criticism and complaining
- my vision of a better way



I want to tell you the recent story about my job.
We are developing a centralised fast payment system.
We have a lot of payment requests every second and we should process them almost immideatly and reliable. 
Our system works not with a end users but with a banks.

Also there is a side project - mobile app for Android and IPhones.
It's goal is to maintain all of the variety of user's accounts in different banks in a single mobile application.
That project was developed by a contractor company.
But our managers breaked up with a head of that company.

We had only Java/Kotlin in our field of responsibility.
But it was widthened with the mobile applications and one more backend programming language.
//need to add some comparison here with another kind of job
It's like as if you are a sushi chief and your manager came to you and said: 
- we are growing so from tomorrow you should start to cook wedding cakes and beef stakes.

We were a bunch of professional with a deep expertise in a narrow field.
That's why our product works so well.
