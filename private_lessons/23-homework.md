## My text
I never was a dancer.
In my early childhood sometimes I had been joggling in the middle of the room to Elthon John's songs. 
But after that the only move I had acted on the dancefloor was the headshaking.
There was a period of my life when I thought that pop and dance music was for a non-deep people. All of the cool guys were listening to rock and metal!
But after my visit to Youth International Festival I found a thirst for a dancing in the deep of mine.
Several days ago I have bought a Just Dance videogame for the Nintendo Switch and now I'm a huge fan of the dancing, LoL.
I have been so excited that even have brought console to the office and have danced with my collegues.
