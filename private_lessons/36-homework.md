# Homework 36

I haven't read or watched anything in these two days that's why I will tell you about my today's meeting.
I've already told you that our project was squashed with another one - a mobile application.
And tasks from that project were added to a common to-do list.
So now we have a lot of work to do.

And these factors have been (were?) the reason for our head to split our 5 development teams into 8.
Today we have had a long call during which we have tried to produce new 8 teams.
But no team wants to be splitted.

Here I need to take a pause to mention, that we knew that we need to grow up.
And we have been hiring new specialists from the start of the year.
But then it was said that we need only 7 teams.
Every team has had 1, 2 or more employees for these new teams.

And a few weeks ago our head has told us that it should be 8 teams, not 7.
And to make it happen we need to make a full reshuffle.
Everyone has been frustrated.
No one has wanted to do anything about it.
