## Polish the speech

Is it possible to be a country leader without institutions of force support?
These institutions are military forces, national security, police and others.
Presidents of Russia, France and the USA have one ~~mutual~~ duty in common: all of them are chiefs of country's military forces.
In the UK prime minister de jure is not a chief of the army, but de facto he is. And he even has a right to launch nuclear missiles.

What is more important is control over the executive government.
President should have the support and loyalty of executives.
If he doesn't than he have no power to control anything else.
Any of his decrees could be ignored.

But the amount of power that executives have is enormous and ~~a~~ president can abuse it.
Countries like these could have a democratic facade, but under it, parliament would be made up of retired generals and corrupted consuls. (need to be explain further)
It's very hard to maintain a balance between the ultimate power of a president and parliament.

I want to believe that in the near future government structure would be supported by the Game Theory mathematical models to build a truly balanced machine of power.
