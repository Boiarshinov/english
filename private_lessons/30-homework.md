## Prepare the speech

Recently I have discovered the history of (any article here?) pretzel.
It was developed in the city of Wiborg by the Franciscan monks during a castle siege.
People inside the castle were starving so that monks organized a massive praying.
All the faithful have crossed their arms on their chest and asked help.
Their call was heard by the God and meal rain dropped from the sky.
Monks cooked bread from this meal in the form of crossed arms.
That's how the pretzel was created.
