For our next class I'd really like you to do the following:

1. Think of your favourite game, get ready to describe it to me. (With as many descriptive words as possible)

2. Make a list of board/computer games that you've heard about/played at least once.
Then think of their substitutes/similar ones (supposing you make a game recommendation to smb but they can't find those on your first list, so you suggest another of the same genre).

The point: to compare them on any possible angles.


Example: I do recommend trying Carcasson (but if you can't find it you could go for Kingdom Builder...)

Make 6-7 pairs of games.


## Homework

### Task 1
Star Realms
- card game
- deck-building game
- illustrated
- expandable
- portable
- fun
- fast 
- interactive
- have a lot of different card combinations
- still supported
- competitive


### Task 2

- Monopoly
- Munchkin
- Carcasson
- Bang
- Uno
- Unknown
- Mafia
- Alias
- Battle mages epic struggle
- Jackal
- Ticket to Ride
- White raven
- 
- Mansions of Madness 2 ed.
- Mice and Mystics
- Arkham Mysteries
- Star realms
- Smash Up
- Terraforming Mars
- Call of Cthulhu
- Tainted Grail
- Chronicles of Crime
- Robinson Cruso 1 ed.
- Eldritch Horror

1. If you love Mansions of Madness 2 ed. mechanics but are not a fan of Lawcraft world then you should try to play the Lord of the Rings tabletop game.
2. Dominion was the first game with a deck-building mechanic and if you love it you will be astonished by the Tyrants of Underneath.
3. Are you tired from Mafia? Then you should try Unknown! It has a similar social deduction mechanic but has more interaction between players.
4. Do you love Sherlock Holmes game? What about the Arkham Mysteries?
5. I do recommend you Mice and Mystics. But if you found it a bit old you could go for Aftermath. It is from the same author but more modern.
6. If you cannot find Jackal anywhere then go and try Carcasson.
7. Battle mages epic struggle could be too surface for someone. There is a lot of more deep card games. For example Codex or even Smash Up.
