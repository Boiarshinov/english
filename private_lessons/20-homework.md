## "Alice in chains" book

The past few years have seen a revival of interest in the Seattle grunge scene that dominated music in the early 1990s. Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden and the only one of the four bands that has continuously kept going for almost thirty years - Pearl Jam.
But the story of Alice in Chains is the most interesting for several reasons: how Layne Staley emerged as one of the most influential vocalists of his generation; their prolific output despite the relatively short period of activity; and also as a cautionary story of how a talented band nearly lost it all and not everyone lived to tell the tale.
Alice in Chains has withstood the test of time and aged well in spite of the difficult circumstances with which the band had to deal.
Their story inspired the famous journalist David de Sola to write a book about one of the most important and influential bands to emerge from the Seattle scene.
