# Future in the past

Future in the past is used to express the idea that in the past you thought something would happen in the future.

```
  thought that
 x --------> x        |
past               present            future
```

- `would` - to volunteer or to promise. Frequently used in [conditional](../conditionals.md) statements
> I knew you would help him if you were there. (volunteer)
> He promised he would send a postcard from Rotterdam. (promise)
- `was going to` - to plan/intention or to predict 
> I knew you were going to the party. (plan)
> Jane said Sam was going to bring his sister with him, but he came alone. (plan)
> I had a feeling that the vacation was going to be a disaster. (prediction)


Future in the past cannot be used in clauses beginning with time expressions such as: `when`, `while`, `before`, `after`, `by the time`, `as soon as`, `if`, `unless`, etc.
Instead of using future in the past, you must use simple past.
> I already told Mark that when he ~~would arrive~~ arrived, we would go out for dinner.


Future in the past perfect continuous:
> We knew she would have been travelling for ten hours by the time she arrived at our house later that night, so she was probably going to be very tired.
