# Sequence of tenses

The term "sequence of tenses" refers to the choice of the verb tense in the subordinate clause depending on the tense of the verb in the main clause. 
The rule of the sequence of tenses means that the tense in the subordinate clause is determined by the tense in the main clause and should agree with it both logically and grammatically.


According to the rules of the use of tenses, the simple present is used instead of the simple future in adverbial clauses of time and condition referring to the future.
> He will ask her about it when he sees her tomorrow.
> She will visit them tomorrow if she has the time.


If the verb in the main clause is in the past tense, the verb in the object subordinate clause should also be used in one of the past tenses.


## Time clauses

Time words:
- `when`
- `before`
- `after`
- `as soon as`
- `until`

### Future and Present
`<main clause> <time word> <present simple/perfect>`
> The meeting will begin as soon as everyone arrives. 
> I am going to review the file before I meet with the new client.

### Past
`<past simple/perfect> <time word> <any past tense>`


When `before` or `after` is the time word, you can use two simple past verbs in a sentence that would normally require one past perfect verb and one simple past verb.
The past perfect is not required because the inclusion of before or after makes the difference in times clear.
`<past simple> <time word> <past simple>`
> Rick’s daughter locked herself in her room after he grounded her.

## Noun clauses
A noun clause is a clause that plays the role of a noun.
> I like _what i see_
If you can replace subordinate clause with the pronoun than it is noun clause.

Starts with
- `I would like to ask`
- `who remembers`
- `This could be the reason`
- etc.

Structure:
`<starting clause> what/when/why/where/who/that <any tense>`.

The tense of the subordinate clause depends only on the context of the sentence.
> I don't know when I will finish my current task.
> I can't understand why she is angry with me.
> This could be the reason why his wife stopped to love him.

The noun clause can be the subject either:
> Whoever smelt it dealt it.

`whether` or `if`

## Relative clause
Noun clause replaces the noun and relative
Linking elements of two parts:
- `who`
- `that`
- `which`
> I saw a woman who ...
> 
- `some`
- `much`
- `many`
- `those`

## Adjective clauses

`<present> -> any tense`
`<past> -> `

> I have three umbrellas one of which is from Paris.
> I have a collegue who works extremely hard.
> There was a park where we played as a child.

preposition comes in the end.
> This is the book I'm talking to you about.

It's preferred to use past simple rather than past perfect


---
## Purpose clause

- `to`
- `in order to`
- `so as`
- `so that` - used to reference. Always goes with additional clause
> Ships carry life boats so that the crew can escape when the ship sinks.

`so as`, `so that` can not be used at the start of a sentence.
Use `in order to` in this case.

negative
> Concentrate on your exercise to not make any mistakes.
