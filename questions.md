# Questions

There are special question words.
These words usage depends on context:
- `who`, `whose`, `which` - people
- `what`, `which` - things
- `where` - place, destination
- `when`, `how long`, `how often` - time
- `how much`, `how many` - quantity
- `why` - reason

`Whose` is used to ask about possession.
> Whose skateboard is this?

`Which` is used when the amount of choices is limited.
> Which one did you choose?

## Subject / Object questions

If `who`, `which`, `what` are the __subject__ of the question, there is no need to use auxiliary verbs.

Here _Peter_ is the subject and _me_ is the object:
> Peter called me.
  Who called you?

Structure of the subject question:
```
Wh- <verb> <object>
```

If `who`, `which`, `what` are the __object__ of the question, we should put verb in the interrogative form.

> I called Peter.
  Who did you call?


Structure of the object question:
```
Wh- <auxiliary> <subject> <main verb>
```

Examples:
> Jim is playing with Richard.
  Who is Jim playing with?
> The book is based on a novel by a Russian writer.
  What is the book based on?
> Steve has left a message for Jim.
  Who has Jim left a message for?
