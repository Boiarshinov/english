# Wishes

There are some patterns to construct a wish.
- wish about the present
`I wish + Past Simple`
> I wish you were here.
`I wish + <subject> could + infinitive`
> I wish he could learn faster.

- wish about the future
`I wish + <subject> would + infinitive`
> I wish they would build a new library.

- regret about the past
`I wish + Past Perfect`
> I wish he hadn't failed the test.
> I wish I had returned home on time.


Also it is possible to use `if only` instead of `I wish`:
> If only he could help me.
