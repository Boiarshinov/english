## Adverb
Adverb is a characteristic for an action.
Examples: `slowly`, `frequently`, `heavily`, etc.

Types of adverbs:
- adverbs of manner - how
> carefully, fast, hard
- adverbs of place - where
> here, there, everywhere
- adverbs of time - when
> yesterday, late, early, never, often
- adverbs of frequency - how often
> monthly, daily

Usually adverbs constructed by adding `ly` to an adjective: `slow -> slowly`.

Order of adverbs:
`manner -> place -> time`
> She sat lazily by the pool all day
But in case of verb of movement the order is:
`place manner time`
> He went to Moscow by plane this morning

Adverbs are used after a verb.
> She sings well.
But adverbs of frequency such as `often`, `usually` go after an auxiliary verb but before a main verb.
> She is never late.
