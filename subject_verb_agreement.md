# Subject-Verb Agreement

Also known as Agreement of Subject and Predicate.

Subject and Verb should agree with number.
There are some rules which helps to distinguish the form of verb: singular or plural.

- If subject is singular than verb is singular too
> He sings in the shower
- If subject is plural than verb must also be plural
> They drink too much
- When subject is composed from several nouns with 'and' preposition, use the plural verb
> Me, myself and I do a lot of work for this project.
- When two or more subjects composed with `or`, `either`, `neither`, use the verb form matched with form of the last subject in list
> The president or the vice president is speaking today.
> The student or the committee members write every day.
- In `there is`, `there are` sentences verb should agree with the following subject
> There are many factors affecting teacher retention.
- Collective nouns are considered singular
> The group meets every week.
