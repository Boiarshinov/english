# Modal verbs

In linguistics and philosophy, modality refers to the ways language can express various relationships to reality or truth.

- `can` (`could`)
- `may` (`might`)
- `must`
- `ought to`
- `need` / `need to`
- `will`
- `would`
- `shall`
- `should`
- `have to`

Modal verbs cannot be used with the will-future, they have no infinitive, no -ing form.


Trailing infinitive used without `to` particle:
> I must finish this project tomorrow.
Exceptions: `ought to`, `need to`, `have to`.
> You have to follow these rules.

## Ability

`can`, `could`, `be able to`

`Can` is more usual than `be able to` in a common speech. 
`Be able to` is more formal.
> I can pay you next week.
> Our university isn't able to take more students.

`Could` is the past form of `can`.
> She could play the violin when she was six.

`Can` for the Present Simple. `Could` for the Past Simple.
For everything other - `be able to`.
> He hasn't been able to call them yet but he can call them tomorrow.

## Probability and possibility

`can`, `could`, `may`, `might`, `will`, `should`, `ought to`, `must`

`might` is less likely than `may`. There is more doubt in it.
> You look not nice, may you have a flue? (90% probability)
> We haven't decided yet, but we might go to Italy. (10% probability)

`maybe` == `perhaps`
> Would you like to go to the cinema tomorrow? - Maybe
If you can't replace `maybe` with `perhaps`, use the `may be`.
> It may be rainly outside.

`Could` often means that something is possible but unlikely.
> You could win a million dollars in this game!

`Can`
> How can they still not be here?

`Might not` and `may not` mean that it is possible that something is not the case, while `could not` means that something is impossible.
> Steve may not get the job.
> I couldn't run a marathon. It's impossible for me.

`Must` and `can't` are opposites. Both indicate certainty, but while `must` means that we are certain that something is true, `can't` expresses our conviction that something is impossible.
> She isn't answering the phone - she must be out.
> Nick can't be in Scotland - I saw him this morning.

In the past tense `must` and `may`/`might` phrases are transforming to present perfect:
> She must has been in America. She knows English so well!
> Anna might has passed the EILTS exam.

`should have done` - regrets
> todo

## Asking for permission

`can`, `could`, `may`, `might`, `will`

`May` is a very polite way to ask someone for permission.


---
## Necessity

Verbs `must`, `need`, `have to`, `should` can be used to declare [necessity and obligation and prohibition](necessity.md).
