# Modal verbs

In linguistics and philosophy, modality refers to the ways language can express various relationships to reality or truth.

- `can` (`could`)
- `may` (`might`)
- `must`
- `ought to`
- `need` / `need to`
- `will`
- `would`
- `shall`
- `should`
- `have to`


Trailing infinitive used without `to` particle:
> I must finish this project tomorrow.
Exceptions: `ought to`, `need to`, `have to`.
> You have to follow these rules.

## Probability

`can`, `could`, `may`, `might`, `will`, `should`, `ought to`

`might` is less likely than `may`. There is more doubt in it.
> You look not nice, may you have a flue? (90% probability)
> We haven't decided yet, but we might go to Italy. (10% probability)

`maybe` == `perhaps`
> Would you like to go to the cinema tomorrow? - Maybe
If you can't replace `maybe` with `perhaps`, use the `may be`.
> It may be rainly outside.
