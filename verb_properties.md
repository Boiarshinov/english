## Mood

### Subjunctive
The subjunctive is a grammatical mood or verb form that is used when referring to wishes, proposals or hypothetical scenarios.

The subjunctive mood is most commonly spotted and used within sentences that contain two or more clauses. In one clause there will be a subjunctive verb, and in the other will be an indicative verb.

Often used with subjunctive verbs:
- `wish`
> I wish he stop using remarks.
- `advice`
- `ask`
- `command`
- `demand`
- `desire`
- `insist`
- `sudjest`
- `recommend`
- `forbid`
- `hope`

Structure:
`<Actor> + <verb> + that + <another actor> + <verb without -s on the end>`
> I advice that you be there tonight
`<Actor> + <anxious adjective> + that + <another actor> + <verb without -s on the end>`
> It's crutial that he sing in performance

`wish you were` - is an odd

We can use past tense with subjunctive mood.
> If only they came

Always `were` instead of `was`
