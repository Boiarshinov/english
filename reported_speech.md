# Reported speech

Direct speech:
> Amy said: "I love your earings"

Indirect (reported) speech:
> Amy said that she loved my earings

`that` is optional.

verb changed to past tense.
That called a __backshifting__.

Tenses are shifting by these rules:
* present simple -> past simple
* present continuous -> past continuous
* present perfect -> past perfect
* present perfect continuous -> past perfect continuous

* past simple -> past perfect
* past continuous -> past perfect continuous
* past perfect -> same
* past perfect continuous -> same

* all future tenses -> just change `will` to `would`

> Artem said: "I forgot to do my homework".
> Artem said that he had forgotten to do his homework.

We should backshift even if we are talking about future:
> The teacher said we had to dress up tonight.


### Reporting verbs
- say
- tell
- agree
- complain
- mention
- ask

Most common are `say` and `tell`.

`tell` should be used with some actor:
> I told you! I told her! I told him! I told the whole world!

`say` can be used with `to someone`. But it's optional.
> I said to her that I was sick.

### Modal words
* `will` -> `would`
* `can` -> `could`
* `may` -> `might`
* `must` -> `had to`

### Reporting questions
If question is a __yes/no question__ than the structure should be:
```
... ask + if/whether + subject + backshifted verb
```
> "Are you a student in the MIT?"
> That lady asked me if I was a student in the MIT


If question is a __WH question__ (who, when, where, how, what, why) than the structure should be:
```
... ask + WH-word + subject + backshifted verb
```

> "Where do you live?"
> She asked me where I lived.

### Reporting commands
Always use a `tell` word with structure:
```
tell + <someone> + to + <infinitive>
```

> My mother told me to sit straight


## Exceptions

We shouldn't backshift if something could not be changing or is not changed yet:
> "I live in the UK"
> She sad that she lives in the UK.

> "Next week I'm flying to Canada"
> He told me that he is flyint to Canada next week
