Infinitive:

- to say why you do smth

> I need to buy some food
> It's not good to bully the weakest.
> She doesn't know where to go or what to do
> I went to the party to meet new people

If a job should be done by someone else `need` could be used with a gerund
> My hair need cutting


### Try
When you are attempting some difficult action and probably you wouldn't have success OR you tried something but failed.
Structure: `... try to <infinitive> ...`
> I try to learn English.
> I tried to climb mountain Everest but it was too high.

When you are having some experiment then it's right to use gerund.
It's about something not difficult but with unknown results.
Also, a gerund is used with giving advice.
> Try switching off the water.
> Try eating this strange fruit. People around here call it Papaiya.


### Remember
`Remember + <-ing>` when you talk about something in the past:
> I remember fighting in WWII.
> Do you remember walking there? There was such a lovely weather that day!

`Remember + to <infinitive>` when you are giving some advice:
> Remember to get your lunch.

Also when you need to remember to do something and then do it.
> I can't remember to do simple things.


### Stop
Stop the action that is in progress right now. In that case, we should use a gerund.
> Stop playing the guitar! I want to sleep!

When you stop to do something else then it's time for an infinitive:
> Billy was so tired of his homework that he stopped to play the guitar.


### Go on
If after `go on` is a _gerund_ then the activity in the gerund continues:
> She went on talking about her new dress for hours!
> We can't go on working like this - we must find a better way.

When `go on` followed by an _infinitive_ then one action stopped and another one is starting.
> After writing his book, he go on to rest a couple of days.


### Regret
`Regret` with _infinitive_ used only in formal cases:
> We regret to inform you that you didn't pass the exam.

In all other cases there should be a _gerund_:
> I regret telling you my secrets!
