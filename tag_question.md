# Tag question

Tag questions are small questions added after a regular sentence.
> You're hungry. Aren't you?

If the first sentence was positive then the question tag should be negative.
If the first sentence was negative then the question tag should be positive.
> They cant afford to buy a house. Can they?

It's very easy to transform regular question into the tag question:
> Are you coming to the party?
> You are coming to the party, aren't you?

If there is no helper verb in the initial phrase then use `do`:
`any verb` -> `do`
> He likes basketball, doesn't he? 

**Exclusion**
`am` -> `are`
> I'm flying to Rotterdam tomorrow, aren't I?


### With modal verbs
- `will`
- `should`
- `could`
- `can`

> We shouldn't be doing this, should we?

`will` -> `want`
> She will clean up the dinning room, want she?


### Asking someone
When you ask someone then try to use `will you?`
> Come here tomorrow. Will you?
