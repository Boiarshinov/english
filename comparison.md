## Comparative and Superlative Forms

Comparative form: `short -> shorter`.
Superlative form: `short -> the shortest`.

Superlative form always comes with `the` article.

After comparative form should be word `than`:
> Jim was taller than Ben.

After superlative form should be words `of/in`:
> Jim was the tallest boy in the class.

Some adjectives cannot be transform to comparative and superlative forms.
In such case we should use `more <adj> than` and `most <adj> of/in`:
> Alice was the most attractive woman in the office.

Some adjectives can be used in both ways:
> He was the most clever boy in the class. She was cleverest woman I've ever seen.

Adverbs can have comparative and superlative forms too:
> He was faster than me.
> After this Mary visit me more often.

- `definetly`

> Average Metallica song is a bit longier than the Lady Gaga song.
