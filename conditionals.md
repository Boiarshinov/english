# Conditionals

There are 4 types of conditionals:
1. general truth
> If you heat ice, it melts.
2. real present
> If he comes late, we will miss the bus.
3. unreal present
> If I were you, I would see a doctor.
4. unreal past
> If you hadn't been rude, he wouldn't have punished you.

Never use `will` after `if`!!!

After `if`, we can use `were` instead of `was` in all persons.

Here we can use `unless` as `if not`:
> Unless you can affor it, don't buy it.
> You won't understand unless you listen carefully


### General truth
Something which is always true, laws of nature
`If <present simple>, then <present simple>`
> When water boils, it transforms to steam.


### Real present
Real or very probable situation in the present or future
`If <present simple>, then <future> / <imperative> / <can/must/may + bare inf>`
> If you can't afford it, don't buy it.
> If you see her, can you give her a message?


### Unreal present
For unrealistic supposition. Also used to give advice.
`If <past simple> then I would/could/might <bare inf>`
> If I were you, I would call to your boyfriend.
> If I had money, I could buy a new car.


### Unreal past
Unreal or improbable situation in the past.
Something happen and nothing could be done.
For something unchangeable when you regret about it:
`If <past perfect> then I would <present perfect>`
> If you had prepared better, you would have passed the exam.
> He wouldn't have fallen from ladder if he had been more careful.
