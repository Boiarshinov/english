# Articles

- `a` / `an` - with singular countable noun in general (not specific) or something that is introduced for the first time
- `the` - with singular or plural countable or uncountable specific noun

With the plural nouns we should use `the` or don't use article at all:
> I have the books in my locker.
> I have books in my locker.

With uncountable nouns we should use `some` or don't use article at all:
> Would you like some tea? 

## Special rules

1. Countries
In most cases you shouldn't use article with the country name:
> I live in England.

But use with acronym countries and group of states/islands:

> I'm from the Netherlands (has -s suffix)
> He is from the USA
