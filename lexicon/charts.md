# Charts

There are a lot of words explaining meaningful drawing that are expressing relations of some components or values:
- `chart`
- `plot`
- `diagram`

Types of charts:
- line chart
- pie chart
- bar chart
- flow chart - for the algorithm of a process
- scatter plot - 
- area chart - chart based on a line chart, but the area below the line is filled with color. This type of chart useful for displaying accumulated total over time
- graph

There are diagrams specific for an IT - UML diagrams.
UML is a universal modelling language.
Most useful of them are:
- sequence diagram
- state machine diagram

- `grid` is a group of pale straight lines that help to determine a value in a big plots.

__Line chart__ 
What type of charts is the most popular and basic one is a line chart.
It looks like a lines on the plane or dots connected with lines.
Line charts are used to show a behaviour of value over time (or something other).

The most hateful part of pie charts is a Microsoft Excel visualisation of them.

I had used them frequently when I worked in a machinery.
I had handled results of expirements by them to determine whether our product satisfies the requirements or not.

__Area chart__
Area chart is great for the visualisation of those types of values that can be integrated by horizontal axis. 
For example it can be used for velocity over time distribution and area below the line would be a distance covered by a vehicle. 
Also these charts give a clear view of prevalence of one value over other values with a precision duration of this prevalence.
