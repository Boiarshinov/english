# Avoiding repetition

## Ellipsis

Omitting some part of the sentence
> How many players in this game?
> Five.

> He is poor, but he is honest -> He is poor, but honest

Omitting subjects:
> Did you have any success? -> Had any success?
> Have you seen Harry today? -> Seen Harry today?

Omitting verbs:
> When young he travelled in the east


### Split infinitive
> Is she coming to the party? She might


### Breaking infinitive
When we finish sentence with `to`
> Are you moving out? - We are planning to

## Substitution
Substitution - replacing

### Pronouns
Nouns can be replaced by the personal pronouns.
`me`, `her`, `him`, `them`, `their`, etc.
> To ensure that our sales staff speak to customers in an appropriate way, management has made the decision to send them on a training course next week.
`them` instead of `sales staff` once again.

### Countable
Quantifier pronouns:
`little`, `none`, `any of them`, `either`, `neither`, `both`, `it`, `one`, `some`.

`One` is used only for replacing countable nouns.


### `Do` for any verb
> None of the team understood the problem at first, but they did after a few days.
> I always a have a shower before breakfast and my wife does the same.

### So, either, neither
Used as a short response to agree or disagree
`And so do I`
`Me either`
`And neither did I`
`I'm not either`
